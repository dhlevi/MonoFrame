# MonoFrame

MonoFrame is a very simple base framework I put together for developing MonoGame projects.

MonoFrame includes a very simple UI implementation, Screen and Content managers, a messaging system and some simple entity and AI controls

An examlple of using the Screen manager with a basic main menu and splash screen is included.

# Future enhancements: 
None planned, but as I add new bits to the framework, they'll be uploaded here (assuming I remember!)

# Libraries and Credits

Built in c#, and uses the MonoGame platform 3.5.0.1678
